Welcome to muNet-AUVsim's documentation!
========================================

**Version:** 0.1.0-beta

**Status:** Beta Release

muNet-AUVsim is a comprehensive Python-based simulation framework for multi-agent
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarm research. The framework provides a complete 
environment for modeling, testing, and evaluating underwater vehicle coordination, 
communication networks, and control algorithms in realistic ocean conditions.

Key Features
============

- **AUV dynamics modeling**: 6-DOF nonlinear vehicle dynamics based on Fossen's
  marine vehicle modeling
- **Virtual ocean environment**: Ocean currents, bathymetry, and environmental
  effects
- **Underwater Communication**: Simulated acoustic networking (muNet) and real AquaNet
  stack integration
- **Modular GNC Architecture**: Flexible guidance, navigation, and control
  systems with plug-and-play algorithms
- **Swarm Coordination**: Multi-agent groups, path following, and target
  tracking
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Animated 3D trajectory plots with real-time
  vehicle states
- **Data Collection & Analysis**: Complete state logging, performance metrics,
  and reproducible simulations
